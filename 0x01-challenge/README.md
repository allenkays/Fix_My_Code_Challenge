# 0x01. Fix my code
## Background Context

Fix my code is a new type of project, where we’ll jump into an existing code base and fix it!

Sometime you will know the language, sometime not.
# Tasks
## 0. Server status

I just started a new Flask project and the first thing I’m putting in place is a route for the status of my API (super important for a load balancer implementation).

But I don’t know why it’s not working…

Could you look at it and fix it please?
